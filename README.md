# Machine Learning 
Machine Learning is a subdomain of artificial intelligence where we analyze and extract patterns from data and make intelligent predictions on new data based on the learnings.

# Deep Learning
It is a further sub category of machine learning which aims at learning feature hierarchies. Autmatically learning features at different level of abstraction can allow complex mapping of input directly to the data without any human intervention for feature engineering. 

## Applications of Deep Learning
Image recognition
Classification and localization
Chatbots 
Search recognition
Music generation
Brain tumor detection


# The OpenAI (Python) API
## What's an API ?
API = Application Programming Interface 
Way to interact with a remote application programmatically

## Why use the API ?
1) Customizable System Messages
2) Adjust Input Parameters(like the max response length, number of responses, etc)
3) Process images and other types of files
4) extract helpful word embeddings for down stream tasks
5) Input audio for transcription and translation
6) Model fine-tuning functionality
